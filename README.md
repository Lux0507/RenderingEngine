# RenderingEngine
With this repository i intend to explore the work computers do, when rendering three dimensional scenes to two-dimensional planes.
The RenderingEngine is not that far develped at this point (10.07.2025). The Goal is currently to just be able to render objects in 3d-space and display them using the [pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/news)
